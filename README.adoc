= Dependency Injection

Sample code to demonstrate the concept of _Dependency Injection_.

It doens't use annotations, Spring or any other magic as Dependency Injection in itself doesn't require it.
However one could implment it using reflection and annotations (like how Spring does it).

== Quickstart

Import the project into IntelliJ and run the _ManualDependencyInjectionApplication_ class.

== Why Manual Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection it's just a concept which helps you think _modularly_ and to write modular and testable code.
